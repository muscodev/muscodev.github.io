Before diving into analysis, it's crucial to understand the context and the problem you're trying to solve. This involves collaborating with domain experts to gain insights into the data's significance.

4. Metrics for analysis:
Metrics are the quantitative measures used to evaluate performance and draw conclusions. They can be simple, like counts and averages, or more complex, like conversion rates and predictive accuracy.

5. Representing data and KPIs:
To present data effectively, you can use various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, heatmaps, etc. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are specific metrics used to track progress toward goals and can be displayed on dashboards or reports.
