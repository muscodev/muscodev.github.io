A lower AHT indicates efficient call handling.</p> </li> <li> <p>First Call Resolution (FCR): The percentage of customer inquiries or issues resolved by an agent during the first call, without the need for follow-up interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Feedback or survey scores provided by customers after interacting with an agent. It measures the level of customer satisfaction with the agent's service.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality Score: The score assigned to an agent's performance during call quality evaluations or monitoring. It assesses adherence to call scripts, politeness, and problem-solving abilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adherence to Schedule: The percentage of time an agent adheres to their assigned schedule, including breaks and lunchtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Occupancy Rate: The percentage of time an agent spends handling calls or engaged in productive work.
